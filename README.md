# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning

This project uses a deep learning model to predict customer churn — whether a customer is likely to stop using a service. It is implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on a real-world churn dataset.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major concern for businesses. Accurately predicting which customers are likely to churn helps in proactive customer retention strategies. In this project, a neural network model is trained to classify customers as likely to churn or not based on their service usage and demographic data.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains features such as:
- Customer demographics (e.g., gender, senior citizen, partner)
- Account information (e.g., tenure, contract type, monthly charges)
- Service usage details (e.g., internet service, streaming, phone lines)

> 📌 *Note: The dataset used here is sourced from Kaggle and was part of a classroom learning session.*
